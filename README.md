# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description

This project is a clone of AirBnB. The first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

## Command Interpreter

### How to start

To start the command interpreter, you need to run `./console.py`.

### How to use

The command interpreter allows us to manage the objects of our project:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

### Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:

$ ./console.py (hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
EOF help quit

(hbnb) (hbnb) (hbnb) quit $
